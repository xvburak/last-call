      <p>Hi, I’m a multidisciplinary designer living, working, and walking around in Chicago. I currently work at
        Landscape, a design studio building brands in service of social good. I’m also an admin at Distant, a creative,
        Slack-based community.

        I would say that I’m a relatively nice person and I describe myself as gently aggressive. I also have a cute
        corgi.

        Q: Can you help me with a project? Like, a logo and maybe a website?
        A: I’m gently available for freelance—send me an e-mail.

        Q: What’s better—milk chocolate or dark chocolate?
